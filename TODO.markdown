TODO
----

Canonical representation of values that's not Python's or Javascript's.

Don't output final value.  Command-line arguments passed to `main`.  (`sysmain`?)

Name mangling for compilers (prepend with `_` most likely.)

input, read, write in all implementations.

Example program with input.  Document it.  print, read, write too.

### Implementation ###

Better use of exceptions (don't use Python's SyntaxError.)

AST nodes should have source line numbers, it would be really nice.

### Design ###

Should there be closures as well as function values?

Should there be an expression form of `if`?

Should there be an expression form of `=`?  (`:=`?)

Should a block be a valid statement, with block scope?

Should we have automatic promotion (value tagging?)
